Consensys Academy Final Project Nov 2021 Solar Panel Purchase NFT Contract Solidity Walkthrough

Users will have to register themselves (i.e connect their Wallet to the UI)

function registerUser(address _User) {

	// registers user

};

They have select which solar panel equipment they wish to purchase

function registerProductToPurchase(uint _solarPanelOptionID) {

	// registers the ID of the solar panel the user wants to purchase
  
  (and the quantity?)

};


They will be asked to mint an NFT to confirm their contract to purcahse a solar panel for their home.

function mintPurchaseContract(address _User, uint _solarPanelOptionID ) { 
	// mints NFT showing user committed to buying solar panel and quantity for their home 
	_ 
};

If the UI detects that there is insufficient ETH in the user's wallet, a new button/window will appears, directing the user to take out a DeFi loan and come back to try to mint an NFT to buy a solar panel, once they have sufficient funds.

function sufficientFunds (uint _solarPanelOptionID) {

	// registers the ID of the solar panel the user wants to purchase
  
  (and the quantity?)
