Solar Panel Purchase NFT Contract Example Workflow

1. Users will have to register themselves (i.e connect their Wallet to the UI)

2. They have select which solar panel equipment they wish to purchase

3. They will be asked to mint an NFT to confirm their contract to purcahse a solar panel for their home.

4. If the UI detects that there is insufficient ETH in the user's wallet, a new button/window will appears, directing the user to take out a DeFi loan and come back to try to mint an NFT to buy a solar panel, once they have sufficient funds.
